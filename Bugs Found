Bug 1: On Sign Up, entering space-only values does not show validation error (should show "Field required").

Bug 2: Password and Confirm Password mismatch doesn't give clear error message.

Bug 3: Forgot password â€“ even with wrong email, sometimes it shows "OTP sent" (should say "email not found").

Bug 4: OTP screen does not auto-focus or clearly indicate OTP input field.

Bug 5: Error message style is inconsistent (some show in red text, some in popups).
